Give view permissions PER PACKAGE, PER REPOSITORY:
1. Go to Pacakges
2. Go to the package of your library
3. Select Package settings
4. In the Manage Actions Access section click on Add Repository
5. Add your repository from where do you want reach your library


-------------------------------------------------------------
If you are using GITHUB_TOKEN for automatic authentication you should know that you must explicitly give view permissions PER PACKAGE, PER REPOSITORY!
So if you have a large volume of internal libraries you want to pull in to your solution you have to go in to each one and allow each package to be used by your new solution.

This takes a surprisingly large number of clicks in a large code base. I certainly hope they improve this process by granting permissions on an organization level
for shared libraries, a bulk select, or command line way of granting permissions en masse.
