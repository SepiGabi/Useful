# 🌍 Angular Environment-Specific Configuration Guide

Since Angular 15, `environment.ts` files are no longer generated by default, but you can still manually configure them.

## 🔧 Generate Environment Files

To restore the classic setup with `environment.ts` files:

```bash
ng generate environments
```

This creates:
- `src/environments/environment.ts`
- `src/environments/environment.development.ts`

And configures build targets accordingly.

## ➕ Add Custom Environments (e.g., `staging`, `qa`)

1. **Create the new file**:
   ```bash
   src/environments/environment.staging.ts
   ```

2. **Update `angular.json`**:
   In your `build` configurations:
   ```json
   "staging": {
     "fileReplacements": [
       {
         "replace": "src/environments/environment.ts",
         "with": "src/environments/environment.staging.ts"
       }
     ],
     "optimization": true,
     "outputHashing": "all",
     "sourceMap": false,
     "extractCss": true
   }
   ```

   Do the same in `serve` if needed.

3. **Build for that environment**:
   ```bash
   ng build --configuration=staging
   ```

## 📦 Use in Code

```ts
import { environment } from '../environments/environment';

console.log(environment.apiUrl); // defined in each environment file
```

## ✅ Best Practices

- Store config like API URLs, feature flags, etc.
- Avoid secrets – use runtime config or secure server-side injection if needed.
