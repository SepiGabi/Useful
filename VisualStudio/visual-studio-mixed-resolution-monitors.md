# Visual Studio on Mixed-Resolution Monitor Setups

When using **multiple monitors with different pixel densities (DPI)**, Visual Studio may exhibit layout issues such as blurry UI, misaligned tool windows, or rendering glitches.

## 🛠 Solution: Adjust DPI Rendering Setting

To improve compatibility across screens with varying DPI settings, adjust the rendering option in Visual Studio:

### ✅ Steps

1. Go to the top menu:  
   **`Tools` → `Options`**

2. In the **Options** window:
   - Navigate to:  
     **`Environment` → `General`**

3. Find the setting:  
   **`Optimize rendering for screens with different pixel densities (requires restart)`**

4. Check or uncheck the box based on your setup:
   - ✅ **Check** it if you're using **multiple monitors with different DPIs**
   - ❌ **Uncheck** it if you're experiencing visual issues or using a single standard-DPI monitor

5. Click **OK**, then **restart Visual Studio** for changes to take effect.
